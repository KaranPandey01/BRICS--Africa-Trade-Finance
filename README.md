# BRICS--Africa-Trade-Finance
A mobile-first platform connecting African farmers and SMEs with BRICS buyers through secure escrow payments, real-time trade listings, AI-powered analytics, and integrated logistics management.
This project is a BRICS–Africa Smart Trade & Finance Platform designed to empower African farmers and SMEs by enabling seamless cross-border trade with buyers across BRICS nations. Built with Flutter, Python, MySQL, and MongoDB, the platform offers product listings, secure escrow-based payments in local and BRICS currencies, logistics integration with real-time shipment tracking, and AI-driven analytics for price forecasting and demand–supply predictions. The system also includes a reputation and credit scoring mechanism to build trust for unbanked SMEs, while ensuring transparency through document storage and compliance features. By merging fintech, distributed systems, and data science, this project addresses a critical gap in Africa’s trade ecosystem and provides a scalable foundation for future BRICS integration.
